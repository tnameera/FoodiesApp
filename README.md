# Foodies: Streamlining Connections with Restaurants

The goal of the Foodies project is to make an app that simplifies where to eat with your friends. 

Using the Yelp API, Twilio API, Google Maps API, HTML/CSS/JS, and Python, the team made a web-friendly UI that displays nearby restaurant information given user preferences, allows for saving liked restaurants, and presents the best options. The team also enabled the app to send real-time text messages among friends interested in dining together.
